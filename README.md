# SketchPad-Project (Part of the Odin Project)
Build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

**The idea of the project is to exercise DOM Manipulation and flexbox(grid shouldn't be used)**

TODO: Improve the project by adding button for choosing color and button for changing if coloring should be done by clicking or hovering.
